PROJ 1.) Got the first project working - no problems

PROJ 2,) BIG problems with the 2nd project and no github source code to reference. FUCK proj #2

PROJ 3.)

from terminal, installed these pkgs.

go mod init github.com/judeharding/golang11/go-bookstore
go get "github.com/jinzhu/gorm"
go get "github.com/jinzhu/gorm/dialects/mysql"
go get "github.com/gorilla/mux"

The flow is:

- the user interact with the routes
- the routes send control to the controllers with logic
- the controllers perform actions on the db
